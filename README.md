# GPS Module Test Using Arduino and TinyGPS++ Library

## Description

This project demonstrates how to interface a GPS module with an Arduino using the TinyGPS++ library. The setup reads and decodes GPS data to display the current latitude, longitude, altitude, date, and time. This information is useful for various applications, including navigation, tracking, and mapping.

## Components Needed

1. **Arduino UNO**
2. **GPS Module (e.g., NEO-6M)**
3. **Breadboard**
4. **Jumper Wires**

## Instructions

### Connecting the Components

1. **GPS Module to Arduino:**
   - Connect the TX pin of the GPS module to digital pin 4 on the Arduino (RXPin).
   - Connect the RX pin of the GPS module to digital pin 3 on the Arduino (TXPin).
   - Connect the VCC pin of the GPS module to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the GND pin of the GPS module to the GND pin on the Arduino.

### Power the Arduino

- Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.

### Upload the Code and Observe the Data

1. **Load the Program:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
   - Write or paste the provided program into the IDE.
   - Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE under the Tools menu.
   - Upload the program to the Arduino.

2. **Monitor the Output:**
   - Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE by selecting Tools > Serial Monitor.
   - Set the baud rate to 9600 in the Serial Monitor.
   - Observe the GPS data (latitude, longitude, altitude, date, and time) printed on the Serial Monitor.

## Project Operation

- **Initialization:**
  - The Arduino initializes serial communication at 9600 baud for both the Serial Monitor and the GPS module.
  - A message "GPS Module Test" is printed to the Serial Monitor.

- **Reading GPS Data:**
  - The software serial port reads data from the GPS module.
  - The TinyGPS++ library decodes the data to extract useful information such as latitude, longitude, altitude, date, and time.
  - When new data is available, it is printed to the Serial Monitor.

## Applications

1. **Navigation:** Used in navigation systems to provide location coordinates.
2. **Tracking:** Implemented in tracking devices to monitor the movement of vehicles, pets, or personal belongings.
3. **Mapping:** Utilized in mapping applications to collect geographical data.
